Step 4. Analysis
================
.. note::

    Under active construction


The analysis section is divided into several sub-sections. 

- Overview 
- TCR -> GEX 
- Prioritisation 
- 

**Version 1.** Preliminar process that include the automated scGate annotation steps

**Version 2.** Improved the process with automations in STEP 1. and STEP 4. (focused extraction with prioritising the TCR order) as well as the post analysis section for easier identificaiton of TCR of interest (extracting the meta-data, filtering and summarising). 

Uploading the files
-------------------

There first tab will show in the side panel the files that can be uploaded. 

This includes:
- Annotated  object (.rds)
- Adding in additional identifiers if needed. This file is merged with the meta-data based on the 'Sample_Name'
    If you dont wish to do this everytime, add the extra identifiers with the STEGO.R::update_sc()
- Two clusTCR2 files (prefex with AG and BD) (.csv)
- TCRex output file (.tsv)

Version 2 of STEGO.R
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Phase 1. Add in simple case (one sample)

Phase 2. Add in one group (one indiviual with multiple time points).

Phase 3. Add in paired analysis (one indiviudal)

Phase 4. Add in paired analysis (multiple individuals)

Version 3 of STEGO.R
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Phase 1. Complex analysis of unpaired samples (3 groups).

Phase 2. Complex analysis of paired analysis with unpaired group (two time points).

Phase 3. Complex analysis of datasets with longitudinal traction.

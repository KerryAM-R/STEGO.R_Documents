Installation
============

To use STEGO, first install R, RStudio and other required programs
------------------------------------------------------------------
#### MAC:
* Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
* Install [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
* Install [Quartz](https://www.xquartz.org)

#### Windows:
* Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org)
* Install [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
* Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)

#### Computer requirements
Recommended to use a 64-bit OS with 16GB of RAM, with ideally 32GB of RAM. This is needed for the memory intensive merging and annotation steps. 

When running STEGO.R merging and annotation steps, we recommend to limited the number of other programs open to help prevent RAM memory issues, espeically if you have <32Gb of RAM. 


Setting up the R Project
------------------------
1. Download from the github repository [STEGO.R](https://github.com/KerryAM-R/STEGO.R) download and unzip the 'Directory_for_Project.zip' [file](https://github.com/KerryAM-R/STEGO.R/blob/main/Directory_for_Project.zip) and rename the folder.
   - This folder contains how to process the data and will be used to set up the R.project environment.


  
2. Open Rstudio
   - Quick tutorial of understanding RStudio environment with this [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIrsOBy5k58) Video.
3. In RStudio Go to File (top left of the screen) -> New project -> Create the new project in the renamed 'Directory_for_Project' Directory.

Understanding the "Directory_for_Project" Folder
------------------------------------------------
Unzip the "Directory_for_Project.zip" file. This folder contains our recommended structure on how to organise your files for each scRNA-seq project. I will refer to these files through out the Tutorial.

This folder contains the following folder:
- 0_Raw_Files
- 1_ClusTCR
- 1_SeratQC
- 1_TCR_Explore
- 1_TCRex
- 2_SCobj
- 3_Analysis
- custom_db
- Figures.Tables
    + Overview
    + QC_Figures
    + TCR and GEX

  
Downloading and installing STEGO.R
----------------------------------
**Step 1.** File -> New File -> R Script 

**Step 2.** Copy all the R code in this document to following to the 'untitled' script (top left panel) 
``` r
# Devtools and BiocManager are required to download the necessary packages from Github and Bioconductor
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("BiocManager")
install.packages("usethis")

# This line will install STEGO
devtools::install_github("KerryAM-R/STEGO.R")
```
**Step 3.** put the cursor on the install.packages("devtools") line, and hit run (top-right corner of the panel) 

**Step 4.** repeat step 3 for install.packages("BiocManager")

**Step 5.** Repeat step 3 for install.packages("usethis")

**Step 6.** repeat step 3 for devtools::install_github("KerryAM-R/STEGO.R")

!!! Possible installing prompts 

    When you see this line: "These packages have more recent versions available. It is recommended to update all of them. Which would you like to update? Enter one or more numbers, or an empty line to skip updates:", answer with  **1** and hit **Enter**.

    On a **Mac** if you see "Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)", answer with  **no** and hit **Enter**. *This same message will appear as an popup on Windows.*

    Once all packages are installed, this will be the final section of the installation process.

```

**Step 7.** Run each of the following the following lines to set up the .Renviron (R environment)
```r
.rs.restartR() # restart R
getwd() # path to current working directory, which will be used for defining where to put the temporary file will be stored.  

e.g. /Users/kerrymullan/Documents/GitHub/STEGO (mac)
onto the end of the line add the Temp folder name e.g. /Users/kerrymullan/Documents/GitHub/STEGO/Temp (mac)
Windows file paths may look differnet from this. 

# this will open the .Renviron hidden file
usethis::edit_r_environ("project")
```
**Step 8.** Pasted the following in the .Renviron:
```
R_MAX_VSIZE=200Gb
TMPDIR = PATH/TO/Directory_for_project/found/with/getwd()/Temp
```

**Step 9.** Save, close .Renviron and restart R to make the changes take effect. 

```r
.rs.restartR() # restart R
```

Running STEGO.R
---------------
Now the the R environment is set up and the STEGO.R and it's dependencies are installed, we can now run the application.

Run the following lines in R. A window will opened that runs the STEGO.R shiny R application. 

``` r
require(STEGO.R)
Load_required_packages()
runSTEGO()
```

You are now ready to process your scRNA-seq with scTCR-seq data!

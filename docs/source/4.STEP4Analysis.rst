Step 4. Analysis
================
.. note::

    Under active construction
    
    This section will include example analyses depending on the type of data present.


The analysis section is divided into several sub-sections. 

- Overview 
- TCR -> GEX 
- Prioritisation 
- 

**Version 1.** Preliminar process that include the automated scGate annotation steps

**Version 2.** Improved the process with automations in STEP 1. and STEP 4. (focused extraction with prioritising the TCR order) as well as the post analysis section for easier identificaiton of TCR of interest (extracting the meta-data, filtering and summarising). 

Application structure
---------------------

Features for all Tabs. 

Uploading the files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There first tab will show in the side panel the files that can be uploaded. 

This includes:
- Annotated  object (.rds)
- Adding in additional identifiers if needed. This file is merged with the meta-data based on the 'Sample_Name'
    - If you dont wish to do this everytime, add the extra identifiers with the STEGO.R::update_sc()
- Two clusTCR2 files (prefex with AG and BD) (.csv)
- TCRex output file (.tsv)

Side bar panel for uploading the four analysis files.

Side Bar Panel 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These drop down menues allow the user to change what is presented on the graphs and the analysis

The selected individuals = Sample Name (default)

Display by Selected Individual = no or yes. This is linked to the "Selected Individual" button. 

Number of plot row  = 2. This allows the user to select the number of rows to display as desired.

The "Split graph by:" button allows for some graphs e.g., Pie charts, to be split by this variable rather than the "Selected Individual"

The user can also select which variable to colour the graphs by with "Colour by:" 

Additionally, the uder can also select the colouring Palettes that includes: "default", "rainbow", "random", "heat.colors", "terrain.colors", "topo.colors", "hcl.colors", "one"

The "one" colour is linked to the "One colour". Additionally all NA variable will be coloured the light grey #E5E5E5

For some of the functions, the user can restrict to "What individuals to include"

This includes both the 
- "Display one individual?"
- "Display one individual"

For instance this is used to filter the TCR table in the clonal abudance section to more easily identify the most abundant cloens relative to a specific sample/individual based on the "selected individuals" button.

The user can also select the plot parameters that are relevant to the majority of the graphs

This includes:
    - Size of the # - size of the numbered axis

Overview
^^^^^^^^
- GEx
    - Percentage (Table)
    - UMAP of the annotation models
    - Pie chart
- TCR
    - UPSET plot (<31)
    - Line graph (clone tracking)
    - expansion (bar) 
    - expansion (UMAP)

TCR-seq -> GEX
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each section has a summary, UMAP, Heatmap, stats, dot-plot and over-representation.

- Clonal abudance
    - Bar graph 
    - Ridge and Violin plots (for a specific gene)
- Exapanded
- ClusTCR
    - Motif 
- Epitope 
    - Load Epitope list 

Automation (TCR -> GEX)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Clonotype 
    - Download public (bar graphs), summary table, dot plot for each public-like clone
    - Download private (single sample)
    - Can restrict based on the calculated priority 1/(sample total * total count)
    
- Cluster 
    - Download the motif, summary table, dot plot for each public-like and private clusters
        - A common cluster is TRAV1-2 TRAJ33 
        - separate alpha and beta cut-offs
    - Priority: 1/(number of nodes * sample total * total count)

- Epitope/Annotation
    - with the epitopes find the associated epitopes from TCRex 
    - Unselect "Add in Epitope data" to focus on the annotations. So, you can identify the TCR linked to specific annotation models (e.g., FunctionTcell)

GEx -> TCR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Annotation
    - Under development 

- Marker 
    - Single marker
    - Dual marker
